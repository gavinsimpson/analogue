\title{Predict locations on a principal curve}
\description{
  Locations on a fitted principal curve are predicted by projecting the
  new observations in \eqn{m} dimensions on to the corresponding closest
  point on the curve.
}
\usage{
\method{predict}{prcurve}(object, newdata, \dots)
}

\arguments{
  \item{object}{
    an object of class \code{\link{prcurve}}.
  }
  \item{newdata}{
    a matrix or data frame of new observations within the space of the
    orginal data. Variables are matched against those of the original
    data via their \code{names} or \code{colnames}. If a data frame is
    supplied, it is converted to a matrix via \code{\link{data.matrix}}.
  }
  \item{\dots}{
    other arguments passed to other methods. Not currently used.
  }

\details{
  Fitting a principal curve involves two procedures. In one, the current
  curve is bent towards the data via the fitting of spline functions
  with distance along the curve as the predictor variable and each
  variable in turn as the response. The second procedure, a projection
  step, involves projecting the observed points in \eqn{m} dimensions on
  to locations along the current curve to which they are closest in the
  hyperspace.

  Given a fitted curve, the projection step can be used to find new
  points on the fitted curve by projecting the new points located in the
  hyperspace on to points on the curve to which they are closest.
}
\value{
  A matrix of points in the space of the original data. Rows correspond
  to the new samples and columns to the variables (ordered as per the
  original data used to fit the curve).

  How these points are ordered along the fitted curve is contained in
  attributed \code{tag}.

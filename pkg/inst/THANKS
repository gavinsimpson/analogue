THANKS

Support, in part, for the development of this package was
provided by the European Union Sixth Framework Programme 
integrated project Euro-limpacs (GOCE-CT-2003-505540).

This package represents a contribution to the project
deliverables.

You can find out more about Euro-limpacs from the project

Thanks are also due to Steve Juggins for his patient
replies to my questions about bootstrapping, and Viv Jones 
for permission to use her RLGH diatom data.

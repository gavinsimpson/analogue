analogue Change Log

Version 0.11-99

	* Preparing for the 0.12-0 release.

Version 0.11-6

	* distance3: removed - redundant attempt to improve `distance()`.

	* distance: `newDistance()` -> `distance()`
	            `distance()`    -> `oldDistance()`

	This implements the change suggested in 0.11-5. `distance()` is
	now using the compiled C versions of the dissimilarity code.

	* oldDistance: (was `distance()`) fixed a bug in the x-only case
	where `method = "kendall"`.

	* Vignette: Updated some details regarding C versions of
	dissimilarity coefs.

	* performance: a tweak to the print method to zap values that
	are effectively 0. Only affects vectors of performance statistics
	not data frames of stats.

	* predict.pcr: Apply transformation function and perform
	predictions for LOO, n k-fold, and bootstrap predictions

	* crossval.pcr: leave-one-out CV was incorrectly averaging over
	components. Now does bootstrap and n k-fold CV.

Version 0.11-5

	* newDistance: (yet another) new distance() replacement to
	interface with fast C versions of the dissimilarity code. This
	one *will* replace `distance()` in version 0.12-0, where upon it
	will be renamed to `distance()` and the current `distance()` will
	be renamed to `oldDistance()`.

	* Unit tests: started adding unit tests using the **testthat**
	package. Hence **analogue** now `Suggests: testthat`.

Version 0.11-4

	* logitreg: fitting is now possible using Firth's bias reduction
	technique via the brglm package.

	Changes to the labels in the output of the `summary` method.

	* plot3d.prcurve: dynamic 3D plot of the data in PCA space with
	the fitted principal curve superimposed.

	* smoothGAM: new smooth function plugin for `prcurve`. Allows
	fitting principal curves via individual GAM models using
	`mgcv::gam` as the engine. The main advantage is that data sets
	with non-Gaussian errors can now be handled more appropriately,
	such as handling count data correctly.

	`smoothGAM` is much slower than `smoothSpline` currently, although
	there is potential for speeding this up via pre-computing some of
	the GAM terms. As an example, the Abernethy Forest example in
	`?prcurve` takes ~10 seconds on my 2-year old laptop.

	* prcurve: improvements to the printed output during fitting (i.e.
	with `trace = TRUE`) displays a progress bar during initial
	estimates of smooth complexities. Residual variance printed to
	fewer decimal places.

	Now returns components `ordination` and `data`, the PCA ordination
	(resulting from `rda()`) and the original data used to fit the
	curve, respectively. This simplifies the `plot` and `lines`
	methods for example.

	* residuals.prcurve: new `residuals` method for principal curves
	extracting or computing various types of residual for a fitted
	curve.

	* plot.prcurve, lines.prcurve: much improved following the
	addition of new components in the object returned by `prcurve`.
	No longer need to supply the original data used to fit the curve.

	The scaling to use for the plot can now be specified via new
	argument `scaling`. This makes the `lines` method more broadly
	useful.

	* chooseTaxa: would drop empty dimensions if conditions resulted
	in just a single taxon being selected. Reported by Michael
	Burstert.

	The warning about `NA`s was also being issued even if
	`na.rm = TRUE` was used. Now fixed.

	* Streamlined some of the documentation to avoid runnning the same
	code many times.

	* plot.sppResponse: accepts a logical vector for argument `which`.

	* wa: now warns if species with no information are removed from
	the analysis, which proceeds as it always has.

Version 0.11-3

	* chooseTaxa: new argument `value` controls whether the data for
	the selected species or a logical vector indicating which columns
	(species) met the selection criteria.

	New argument `na.rm = FALSE` to control whether or not `NA`s are
	excluded from the calculation of abundance and occurrence. Suggested
	by Michael Burstert.

	* scores.prcurve: now preserves the rownames on the `lambda`
	component.

	* sppResponse: new generic function for species responses along
	gradients. A method is provided for objects of class "prcurve"
	is the only available method currently. A `plot()` method for
	`sppResponse()` objects is also provided.

	* rankDC: new function to compute the rank correlation between
	gradient distances (e.g. environmental variables) and distances
	in species composition. Has both base and Lattice graphics plot
	methods (the latter via `dotplot()`).

	* Stratiplot: new arguments `labelAt` and `labelRot` allow the
	placement and rotation variable labels to be controlled, when not
	using a strip.

Version 0.11-2

	* timetrack: plot method now allows plotting of "lc" or "wa"
	site scores for the base ordination. The latter is the default
	to maintain backwards compatability.

	The `formula` argument was not well implemented; using it would
	mean that `X`, the main species data, would not be transformed,
	and you couldn't use direct variables as these would not be found.

	Now `formula` takes a one-sided formula describing the constraints.
	Variables will be looked up inside the object passed to `env`. As
	such, `env` needs to be a data frame or an object accepted as the
	`data` argument in `model.frame()`.

	The `fitted` method has changed slightly. The `type` argument
	has been renamed `which`.

	* scores: new methods for objects of class "timetrack" and
	class "prcurve".

	* analog: gains a method for objects of class "distance".

	* distance: gains a new attribute ('type') which contains an
	indicator of whether the distance matrix is symmetric (computed
	on a single matrix) or asymmetric (dissimilarities between samples
	of two matrices).

	* distanceX: experimental replacement for distance() which uses
	fast C code for computing dissimilarities via a .Call interface
	based on base::dist().

	Currently only the single matrix code has an R interface and
	`method = "mixed"` is not hooked up at the moment. It is intended
	that the next version of analogue (0.12-x) will have this version
	of the code replace the old mainly R-based distance().

	* predict.wa: deshrinking step sometimes produced a 1 column
	matrix, which would result in an error. This empty dimension is
	now dropped.

Version 0.11-1

	* scores.prcurve: new function to extract "axis" scores for
	samples on the fitted principal curve.

	* lines.prcurve: new lower-level plotting function allows
	a fitted principal curve to be added to an existing PCA
	plot.

	* prcurve, smoothSpline: `prcurve` now returns a component
	`smooths`, a list containing the fitted smoothers, one per
	variable. As a result `smoothSpline` now also returns the
	fitted `smooth.spline` model.

	* gradientDist: the "prcurve" method was ordering the samples
	such that they were smooth. No need for the `order` argument
	now either.

	* Namespace: simplified the import from lattice. Added more
	imports from grid as this package no-longer in Dependencies.

	* Dependencies: grid moved to Imports:

	* distx.c: Uninitialised variable use reported on MacOS X under
	the clang compiler. Reported by Brian Ripley.

	* Maintainer: Updated the maintainer email address.

Version 0.11-0

	* timetrack: fitted method gains argument `choices` with
	default `1:2` for extracting the ordinary or passive
	samples scores on `choices` axes. `plot` method can now draw
	the passive samples as a line, points or both. The `plot`
	method also gains an argument `order` that can be used to
	reorder the passive samples into correct temporal ordering.

	* Dependencies: MASS and mgcv moved from Depends: to Imports:
	reflecting the relatively light use of functions from these
	packages in analogue. The functions needed are imported in
	analogue's NAMESPACE file.

	* Tests: code in wa() generates slightly different results
	under R 3.0.0 (to be). Differences are in the 8th or 9th
	decimal place so irrelevant, but I was using the reference
	output for the examples was checking to that level of precision.
	For tests only, the Example in ?wa uses options(digits = 5).

Version 0.10-0

	* Release: Version 0.9-11 plus a minor documentation fix
	was released to CRAN 2 Jan 2013.

Version 0.9-11

	* Was loading compiled code both via the package namespace
	and a .onAttach() call. The latter was removed. Reported by
	Kurt Hornik.

Version 0.9-10

	* stdError: Several changes and enhancements:

	Calculation assumed weights summed to 1. New formula as
	described in Simpson (2012) is now used. (Reported by Steve
	Juggins)

	Now have a choice whether to use the weighted SD or not. For
	predictions based on the mean of the k-closest analogues it
	would be odd to then use a weighted SD to compute the standard
	error.

	Gained a print method.

	* caterpillarPlot: can now be called by the shorter name
	caterpillar().

	* plot.logitreg: bug would cause plotting to fail if you plotted
	a single model.

Version 0.9-9

	* prcurve: added a print method.

	* Stratiplot: y-axis padded by 4% of range as per base graphics
	default behaviour.

	* plot.wa: don't rerun example(wa) just to plot.

	* caterpillarPlot: tolerance ranges for taxa drawn with lwd = 2.

Version 0.9-8

	* panel.Stratiplot: `type = "h"` now drawn using `lwd = 3` and with
	`lineend = "butt"`. The line width can be controled by new argument
	`lwd.h`.

Version 0.9-7

	* Stratiplot: In 0.9-5 a change was made to stop stripping NAs
	when using the formula interface. This means a way of dealing with
	NAs in the default plotting method is required especially when
	plotting using lines or poylgons, as Lattice will honour the NA
	and draw lines and polygons with gaps.

	Stratiplot.default gains argument `na.action` which defaults to
	`"na.omit"`. Note this is different to the formula method where
	we *want* NAs to propogate through to the default method for
	plotting.

	This change allows for datasets collected on different sediment
	intervals from the same core to be combined in a single diagram.

Version 0.9-6

	* caterpillarPlot: now no longer draws a box round the plot.

	Bug fixed so that the data.frame method correctly identies the
	`env` argument to label the plot with.

	Updated help file.

Version 0.9-5

	* Stratiplot: the formula interface was stripping rows with NAs.
	This wasn't intended but was the result of not implementing all
	of the standard non-standard evaluation idiom used by many of R's
	modelling functions.

	This is now fixed and the default for the `na.action` argument
	has been changed to `"na.pass"`.

	The default `Stratiplot()` method was working as expected.

	* Vignette: typo fixed (reported by Marta Rufio).

Version 0.9-4

	* logitreg: the returned object has changed. The list of logistic
	regression models is now returned as component `models`.

	New methods `fitted()` and `predict()` provided for objects of
	class "logitreg" compute the fitted probabilities for the
	training set samples and for new (e.g. fossil) samples
	respectively. The probabilities are in respect to the analogue-
	ness of samples to the groups in the training set (e.g.
	vegetation biomes in the case of pollen data).

	These changes allow an analysis similar in spirit to that of
	Gavin et al (2003, Quaternary Research 60; 356--367) in their
	Figure 8. Here though logistic regression fits are used rather
	than the ROC method they employ. Similar methods could be
	provided for objects fitted by `roc()` but require a little more
	thought about how to model the likelihood ratios derived from
	the ROC curves.

Version 0.9-3

	* wa: deshrinking via a monotonic cubic regression spline
	is now available via `deshrink = "monotonic"`. This uses
	functions from the *mgcv* package of Simon Wood and as a
	result, *analogue* now Depends on that package too. The
	exact nature of the dependency may change before 0.10 is
	released.

	This idea goes back to ter Braak & Juggins (1993; Hydrobiologia
	*269/270*, 485--502) and Marchetto (1994; Journal of
	Paleolimnology *12*, 155--162), but the implementation here
	uses monotonic constraints after Wood (1994; SIAM Journal on
	Scientific Computing *15*(5), 1126--1133 and follows Steve
	Juggins' implementation borrowing code from `?pcls` in *mgcv*.

	* predict.wa: example was enclosed in \dontrun{} without
	reason. This example is now run.

Version 0.9-2

	* wa: small tolerances can now be replaced by the mean
	tolerance of the set of tolerances that are not small.

	* splitSample: several bug fixes and sanity checks.

Version 0.9-1

	* splitSample: new function to sample a test set from across
	an environmental gradient by breaking gradient into a series
	of chunks and sampling approximately equally from within each
	chunk.

Version 0.9-0

	* caterpillarPlot: new function that draws a caterpillar plot
	of species WA optima and tolerances. Methods for data frames
	and wa() fits are available alongside the default method.

Version 0.8-2

	* Dependencies: analogue now requires R >= 2.15.0

	* Replaced remaining instances of `.Internal`; now use
	`.colSums` and `.rowSums` from R 2.15.0

	* Deleted jss.bst from inst/doc

	* Vignettes: these are now in vignettes not inst/docs

Version 0.8-1

	* cma: if cutoff meant that all analogues returned for all
	sites, code would return an array instead of the usual list.
	This is now fixed in all methods.

	* Replaced instances of `.Internal(sample(....))` with
	`sample.int(....)` at request of Brian Ripley.

Version 0.8-0

	* Updated Example test checks and packaged for release to CRAN
	Jan 11, 2012.

Version 0.7-7

	* mat: new argument `kmax` can be used to limit the number of
	analogues considered as models when fitting MAT transfer
	functions. By default, `mat()` considers models with 1 through
	to n-1 analogues (n = number of sites). `kmax` can control this
	upper limit which will speed up fitting models, especially for
	large training sets. Invariably one wouldn't want to average
	over entire training sets to produce predictions, or even over
	large numbers of analogues. As such I may set an upper limit for
	the default value of `kmax` before this is released to CRAN.

	* cumWmean, cummean: as a result of the above addition of `kmax`,
	these two functions now take a `kmax` argument also. The default
	behaviour is unchanged however.

	* chooseTaxa: `type = "OR"` was not working due to a typo. It
	returned the same as `type = "AND"`.

Version 0.7-6

	* Stratiplot: Handling of absolute data types was broken. Fix
	applied that should allow this to work if there are only
	absolute scale variables or a mix or relative and absolute
	data. All reletaive data should be unaffected.

	* panel.Stratiplot: gains arguments `gridh` and gridv` which
	control the number of horizontal and vertical grid lines used
	on each panel. These correspond to the `h` and `v` arguments of
	`panel.grid` in the Lattice package. The default is `-1` for
	both, which attempts to align the grid lines with the tick marks.

Version 0.7-5

	* weightedCor: implements one of the tests from Telford & Birks
	(2011, QSR) based on the weighted correlation of WA optima and
	constrained ordination species scores. Has a plot method.

	* rdaFit: Non-user (currently) function that implements RDA
	without all of the overhead of vegan::rda. As such it doesn't
	compute PCA axes and does not return all the components described
	by ?cca.object in package vegan. This function is used principally
	in weightedCor(). Has a scores() method. rdaFit() is not
	documented as the exact details of the function and its
	capabilities remain to be determined.

Version 0.7-4

	* gradientDist: new function to extract locations along an
	ordination axis. Methods for prcurve() and cca().

	* varExpl: new function to extract the amount of variance
	explained by ordination axes. Currently methods for prcurve() and
	cca() are available.

	* Namespace: analogue now has an explicit name space in
	preparation for R 2.14.0-to-be. Hence analogue now depends on
	Vegan >= 1.17-12.

Version 0.7-3

	* pcr: coef(), fitted(), residuals(), eigenvals(), performance(),
	and screeplot() methods added.

Version 0.7-2

	* pcr: new function pcr() performs principal components
	regression. Designed to allow transformations in the spirit of
	Legendre & Gallagher (2001) that allow PCA to be usefully
	applied to species data.

Version 0.7-1

	* crossval: new function to perform leave-one-out, k-fold,
	n k-fold, and bootstrap cross-validation on transfer function
	models. A method for wa() models is provided.

	* tests: package now has a test that the examples continue to
	return correct output.

Version 0.7-0

	* timetrack: new function to passively project sediment core
	samples within an ordination of training or reference set
	samples. Both unconstrained and constrained ordinations are
	supported using the Vegan package. 'fitted' and 'plot' methods
	are available.

	* prcurve: new function to fit principal curves to sediment
	core samples. A 'plot' method is also provided. The function uses
	functionality from the princurve package, which is now a
	dependency.

	Several support functions are also provided; 'smoothSpline' is
	a wrapper to 'smooth.spline' for fitting splines to individual
	species in order to fit the principal curve. 'initCurve'
	implements several methods for initialising the principal curve.

	* Stratiplot: if 'zones' are supplied, a legend on the right-hand
	side of the diagram can be drawn by setting argument 'drawLegend'
	to TRUE (the default). Currently, only simple blocks that
	demarcate the zone boundaries are drawn and labelled using
	argument 'zoneNames'.

	First attempt to allow both relative (percentages or proportions)
	and absolute variables, or mixtures thereof, in a single plot. The
	user is free to specify which variables should be treated as relative
	or absolute, and variables marked as absolute will be drawn with
	fixed-width panels, the size of which can be controlled via argument
	'absoluteSize' (default is 0.5 * largest panel width). Consider
	this functionality unstable at the moment.

	* residLen: was not 'join'-ing the training set and passive data
	correctly and would fail if species were found in one but not the
	other data set.

	* tran: improvements to the underlying code.

	* distance: resilience to NA in "gower", "alt.gower", "mixed".

	* cma: added methods for 'mat' and 'predict.mat' objects. These
	allow you to retrieve the k-closest analogues for training set
	and prediction data respectively.

	* dissimilarities: new method for 'mat' objects.

	* datasets: package datasets have been resaved with optimal
	compression determined via resaveRdaFiles(). This has reduced
	the package tarball size considerably. As a result, however,
	analogue now requires R version 2.10.0 or later.

	* predict.wa: bug in bootstrap and k-fold CV methods when
	tolerance down-weighting was used.

	* fixUpTol: erroneous error criterion would cause CV of WA models
	with tolerance down-weighting to stop with an error.

	* waFit: new function that encapsulates the main WA computations.
	This is currently used by wa() and with the intention of being
	used in all functions that computed WA transfer function models.

	* Examples: Streamlined some further examples to use Imbrie &
	Kipp data set, and to not re-run the same code again. Improves
	package check times by a second or two on my PC.

Version 0.6-26

	* abernethy: New data set containing the classic Abernethy Forest
	data of Birks and Mathewes (1978)

	* Stratiplot: Preserves the names component as far as is
	possible, even to the extent of processing the names after the
	manipulations arising from the formula interface.

	Bug in padding of the y-axis now fixed; default is to add 1% of
	the range y-axis to the y-axis limits specified.

	Bug in computing length of variable labels when 'strip = FALSE'
	now fixed.

	* panel.Stratiplot: Add capability to draw zones on stratigraphic
	plots via new argument 'zones' which takes the numeric levels of
	the zone boundaries on the scale of the plot y-axis. How the
	zone markers are drawn can be controlled via several graphical
	parameters. See ?panel.Stratiplot.

	* chooseTaxa: Explicitly preserves row and column names.

	* DESCRIPTION: prematurely added princurve as a dependency in
	previous version.

Version 0.6-25

	* chooseTaxa: new function to select species on basis of number
	of occurrences and maximum abundance. Function is an S3 generic
	with a default method.

Version 0.6-24

	* Dependencies: package now depends on package 'grid'.

	* Stratiplot: gains ability to draw variable labels above the
	plot panels so that the plots conform to common standards. If
	you prefer the 'strips' of Lattice plots, set 'strip = TRUE'
	to get the old behaviour.

	Stratiplot was fixinging the min(ylim) value at 0 and contained
	redundant calls to set the y-axis limits. The behaviour has been
	rationalised and a new 'ylim' argument added. The default
	behaviour uses the range of the y-data for 'ylim'.

	* panel.Stratiplot: fix warning messages (from Grid) due to
	inappropriate colour specification. Reference lines in
	Stratiplot now plot correctly again.

	* plot.roc: was resetting the plotting region at the end of
	plotting even when there was no need to do so.

	* residuals: Residuals were defined as \hat{x}_i - x_i to match
	fitted vs. observed scatterplots. Definition of residuals in wa()
	and related functions has been changed to the more common
	definition of x_i - \hat{x}. Reported by Andreas Plank and Steve
	Juggins.

	* plot.wa: Following changed definition of residuals, plot.wa()
	now plots observed values on the y-axis and fitted values on the
	x-axis for 'which = 1'.

	* summary.predict.mat: print method was incorrectly extracting
	the model estimates for training set samples.

	* predict.wa: fix minor bug with CV when tolerance DW was used.

	* Package: reduced package check time in examples, by using
	the Imbrie & Kipp data.

Version 0.6-23

	* tran: 'rootroot' transformation was same as 'cuberoot' from
	changes made in r140. Now fixed.

	* wa: 'formula' method was not passing tolerance-related arguments
	to default method. As such, the newer code to handle small
	tolerance values was not being invoked when using the formula
	interface to wa().

	Code was also tidied a bit.

	* fixUpTol: was inappropriately matching one of it's arguments.

	* roc: In some circumstances, the generation of the points at which
	the ROC curve was evaluated resulted in more points than the other
	statistics. Fixed to use the points established by 'table', used to
	generate these other statistics. This affected the plot method.

	* plot.roc: Allow user to specify the line types used to draw the
	plots. Two line types can be specified for plots comparing analogue
	with non-analogue statistics.

	New argument 'abline.lty', which defaults to "dashed", controls
	plotting of the optimal ROC dissimilarity threshold.

	* plot.minDC: argument 'lty.quantile' was not being used by the
	graphical function that drew the quantiles of the pairwise D[ij]s.

	* plot.bayesF: New argument 'abline.lty', which defaults to "dashed",
	controls plotting of the optimal ROC dissimilarity threshold.

Version 0.6-22

	* tran.formula: bug in my implementation of the standard
	non-standard evaluation technique used within the formula method
	for 'tran'. Diagnosis and fix by Prof. Brian Ripley.

Version 0.6-21

	* distx.c, distxy.c: Warning due to non ISO C-compliant 'mistake'
	in experimental code for Gower's Mixed coefficient.

Version 0.6-20

	* Stratiplot: was not respecting the sort variable under certain
	conditions.

	* panel.Stratiplot: typo in Rd file was causing warnings in R
	version 2.10.0-beta.

Version 0.6-19

	* join: gains ability to return the inner join of the supplied
	data frames. This is the intersection of the set of variables
	in the supplied data frames, the set of variables common to the
	supplied data frames.

Version 0.6-18

	* join: new arguments 'type' and 'value'.

	'type' controls which join is performed. Options are (currently)
	"outer" (default) and "left". The left join is used to prepare two
	or more data sets for ordinating the first and subsequently
	passively projecting the other data sets into this ordination.
	The outer join is used to prepare data for transfer functions such
	as MAT and WA.

	'value' allows the user to supply a numeric value to be used to
	replace 'NA's.

Version 0.6-17

	* predict.wa: deshrinking method was not being honoured when
	expanding predictions.

	* Stratiplot: gains option ('rev') to reverse the y-axis limits.

	Can now also sort/order the columns of 'x' (the species or
	variables) as weighted averages of 'y' (to emphasise the change
	in composition along 'y'), or using a supplied variable. The
	latter is useful if you want to sort the variables by their optima
	with an environmental variable.

	Now also provides a guess as to the y-axis label if none is supplied.

Version 0.6-16

	* roc: For large problems the calculation of AUC and its standard
	error could overflow the largest number R currently handles. roc()
	now has two new arguments, 'thin' and 'max.len', which allow the
	number of points on the ROC curve to be thinned to a smaller number,
	which should allow the computations to be performed. The original
	problem was reported by Diana Stralberg.

Version 0.6-15

	* tran: new 'formula' method allows simple selection or exclusion
	of variables from the set to be 'tran'sformed.

Version 0.6-14

	* tran: new transformation and standardization methods for the power
	and 4th root transformation, the log ratio transformation for
	compositional data, plus row (sample) centring.

Version 0.6-13

	* predict.wa: Now handles WA with tolerance down-weighting for
	bootstrap CV and benefits from the changes introduced in previous
	version.

Version 0.6-12

	* deshrink, deshrinkPred: New utility functions for deshrinking WA
	estimates. These replace the '*.deshrink' and 'deshrink.pred' internal
	functions used to this end to date. This provides a more extensible
	solution.

Version 0.6-11

	* tran: now converts input data to matrix using 'data.matrix' which
	deals with factor variables appropriately.

	* predict.wa, wa, WATpred: Now use faster C code for computing
	predictions from WA models with tolerance down-weighting.

Version 0.6-10

	* predict.wa: Predictions with tolerance DW now works for CV = "LOO"

	* wa.formula: Argument list updated to match wa.default.

	* fixUpTol: New internal utility function the encapsulates code to
	modify working tolerances within WA model fitting.

	* w.tol: Internal function w.tol now uses a faster C version of the
	code.

Version 0.6-9 (Closed Sun 7 June 2009)

	* predict.wa: Predictions without CV can now be made for WA models
	fitted using tolerance DW.

	* wa: Now returns the options for tweaking tolerances as part of
	model object in component 'options.tol', which is a names list.

	* Utility functions: WApred() and WATpred() internal functions for
	predictions using WA or WA with tolerance DW.

Version 0.6-8 (Closed Mon 5 May 2009)

	* residLen: new function to compute squared residual length
	diagnostic for passive samples in a constrained ordination. Used as
	a test of whether core samples are well fitted in a transfer function
	model.

	Several utility functions to compute fitted values from an ordination
	and corresponding residual lengths are provided, which me be useful
	for authors of other functions.

	'plot' and 'hist' methods produce density plots and histograms for
	'residLen' objects using base graphics.

	'densityplot' and 'histogram' methods for 'residLen' objects using
	Lattice graphics.

	* stdError: new function to compute the weighted standard deviation
	of the environment values for the k closest analogues in MAT models.
	This can be used as an uncertainty measure for MAT fitted values or
	transfer function predictions.

	Methods are available for 'mat' and 'predict.mat'.

	* predict.mat: now returns the dissimilarity matrix between the
	training set samples and samples in 'newdata'.

	* getK: new method for 'predict.mat'.

	* CITATION: updated as per request from Kurt Hornik and CRAN.

Version 0.6-7 (Closed Mon 13 Apr 2009)

	* optima, tolerance: new methods to coerce objects of these classes
	to data frames.

	* distance: method = "kendall" was incorrectly computing the min of
	the x and y components in the dissimilarity.

Version 0.6-6 (Released to CRAN: Wed 25th Feb 2009)

	* optima, tolerance: New print methods for both functions. Returned
	objects now have additional attributes.

	* join: new methods for 'head' and 'tail' to return the first/last
	few rows from each of the joined data sets. Handles cases where
	'split = FALSE' by calling the 'data.frame' method.

Version 0.6-5

	* wa: now computes tolerances and can perform tolerance downweighting
	in WA transfer functions. Contains several options to manage working
	tolerances used in the WA computations, including how to deal with
	species that have very small (narrow) tolerances.

	The actual tolerances and working values are returned from wa().

	* optima, tolerance: two new user visible functions to compute weighted
	average optima and tolerance ranges from species abundances and 
	associated environmental data.

Version 0.6-4

	* Datasets: Version 1.7 of the North American Modern Pollen 
	Database has been added to 'analogue'. The data are contained
	in four datasets: Pollen, Biome, Climate and Location, containing
	the pollen counts on 134 taxa, vegetation classification, 32
	climatic variables and location (latitude/longitude) respectively
	on 4833 sampling locations in North America and Greenland.

	* plot.logitreg: adjusted the correction to the degrees of freedom
	in the calculation of the confidence intervals.

	* roc: now returns the observed prior probability that two samples 
	are analogues for each group. Also returns the index of the point 
	along the ROC curve where the slope of the curve is maximal (the 
	point corresponding to the optimal dissimilarity).

	* bayesF: now returns the posterior probabilities as well as 
	posterior odds of true analogue and true non-analogues for points 
	along the ROC curve.

	Documentation of the object returned from 'bayesF' has been updated
	to match the changes introduce in version 0.6-0.

	* wa: documentation for wa did not state that the 'tol.dw' argument
	was currently ignored. Tolerance down weighting is not currently
	implemented in wa and the documentation now states this clearly.
	Reported by Andreas Plank (R-Forge Bug ID 287).
	
Version 0.6-3

	* logitreg: new function to evaluate the probability that two
	samples are analogues conditional upon the dissimilarity between
	the two samples. Essentially fits logistic regression models to
	the data used to produce the statistics drawn on a ROC curve.

	Methods for 'summary' and 'plot' are currently available.
	
	* analog: was converting 'x' and 'y' objects to matrices before
	calling distance(). This broke handling of factor variables in
	'method = "mixed"' with distance().

	* distance: objects created by distance() now have an explicit 
	class "distance", and inherit from class "matrix".

	* roc: component 'statistics' has reordered columns.

	* plot.roc: superficial changes to ordering of plot components.

	* Depends: Package now depends on MASS. No longer need dependency 
	on brglm.

Version 0.6-2

	* Stratiplot: new graphics function for plotting stratigraphic
	diagrams, with 'default' and 'formula' methods. Uses the Lattice 
	package for plotting.

	* panel.Stratiplot: lattice panel function for drawing stratigraphic
	diagrams.

	* panel.Loess: modified version of standard lattice panel function
	'panel.loess' for drawing LOESS smooths on stratigraphic diagrams.

	* Documentation: fixes and tweaks to several Rd files to fix parse
	errors caught with the new Rd parser coming in R 2.9.0. 
	
Version 0.6-1

	* ImbrieKipp: made the training set environment and sediment core
	data set names easier to manage. The three environmental variables
	are now in seperate data sets ('SumSST', 'WinSST', and 'Salinity')
	as named, numeric vectors of the same name as the data sets.

	* mat: example now uses the ImbrieKipp data resulting in large
	speed-up.

	* Requires: package now depends on package 'brglm' for use in
	modelling probability of analogue or not. For future 'logitReg()'
	function.

Version 0.6-0

	* roc: new version of roc, which correctly computes the no-analogue
	part of the ROC analysis. Now roc returns information on individual
	grops as well as an overall or combined ROC curve for the data.

	The number of close analogues to use in computing the ROC curve
	can now also be specified.

	These changes have altered bayesF() and the plot methods for bayesF
	roc. bayesF now computes Bayes factors for all groups as well as
	for the overall ROC analysis.

	The plot method for bayesF will now plot the Bayes factors for all 
	groups or for a single, named group. plot.roc has been updated to 
	work with the new roc object, and by default, the plots refer to the 
	overall ROC curve. Which group is plotted is controlled by new 
	argument 'group'.

	There is now a summary method for roc that displays summary data for
	the individual ROC curves.
	
	* fuse: new function to fuse (combine) two or more 
	dissimilarity objects.

	* ImbrieKipp: New data sets containing the classic Imbrie and Kipp
	(1971) training set.

	* tran: tran was clobbering dimnames. These are now preserved.

	* .first.lib: package startup now uses packageStartupMessage() 
	to display the startup message.

	* distance: speed up in calculating range and maximum statistics
	for those dissimilarity coefficients that incorporate these terms.

	distance() now also returns the dissimilarity coefficient used as
	attribute "method"

	* mat: was converting 'x' to matrix too early, which upset some of 
	the DC methods.

	mat also now passes arguments in '...' on to distance. This allows
	additional options required for some dissimilarity coefficients to
	be provided.

	* print.mat, summary.mat: quantiles of dissimilarities are now much
	more efficiently calculated.

	* plot.mcarlo: now works correctly for both types of plot, and 
	computes ranges so that histogram and density estimates fit into
	plotting region.

Version 0.5-3

	* tran: new function to apply common transformations and 
	standardizations applicable to palaeoecolgical data.

	* predict.wa: added k-fold ("nfold") cross-validation.

Version 0.5-2

	* wa: classical deshrinking did not work, but returned the
	original 'env' variable. Currently a bit inelegant
	implementation. 
	
	* wa: implemented deshrink = "none" just for comparison and for
	connoisseurs. 

	* wa: deshrink = "expanded" is now public and user-callable.

	* join: now checks for inherits(foo, "data.frame") to confirm
	if all objects to join are (or inherit from) data frames. This
	allows join to work on objects of class "join" when split = FALSE
	is used.
	
Version 0.5-1

	* New developer: Jari Oksanen has joined the analogue team!

	* predict.wa: was not returning some attributes of the WA model
	fitted. This was causing some print and other methods to fail.

	* expand.deshrink: implemented simple expansion of variances as a
	deshrinking method a bit like in vegan:::wascores.  The function
	has similar API as other deshrinking functions: takes only WA and
	obs values as input, and returns expanded scores and two linear
	coefficients to perform the deshrinking.  Slope is given by the
	expansion ratio and intercept is defined so that the line goes
	through mean(x), mean(y) point.  The vegan function equalizes
	weighted variances, but this function only uses simple variances:
	incorporating weights would mean changing call API. At the moment
	the function is not yet used anywhere, but just sits there waiting
	for possible use.

	* wa, mat models: residuals are now calculated as predicted -
	observed.  This reverses the sign from the previous version. There
	was inconsistency in the way residuals were being calculated in
	MAT models and help functions. Now resolved.

	* plot.mat: now plots the absolute value of the average or maximum
	bias statistics, rather than the actual value. This ensures that
	the "optimal" model is the one with the lowest value on the plot.

	* Internal: The way deshrinking was handled internally has been
	substantially streamlined, via the *.deshrink and deshrink.pred
	internal functions.

Version 0.5-0

	* wa: new function wa() with default and formula interfaces
	for fitting Weighted Averaging transfer function models. plot,
	fitted, residuals, coef, minDC, performance (see below), 
	predict and bootstrap methods are provided.

	* performance: new extractor function to retrieve model
	performance statistics. Currently, methods provided for 
	wa, predict.wa, and bootstrap.wa objects.

	* reconPlot: new method for predict.wa objects.

	* RMSEP: new method for bootstrap.wa objects.

	* Vignette: analogue now has a vignette covering the analogue 
	methods implemented in the package. This is based on the paper
	Simpson G.L. (2007) Analogue Methods in Palaeoecology: Using 
	the analogue Package. Journal of Statistical Software, 22(2),
	1--29.

	* plot.minDC: Bug in drawing the axis for the quantiles.
	
Version 0.4-4

	* Updated the Version: field in DESCRIPTION to meet new
	standards introduced in R 2.6.0 for licence files.
	Reported by Kurt Hornik.
     
	* join() now returns a object of class "join" or 
	c("join", "data.frame") depending on argument split.
     
	* distance() is now generic and has a new method for
	objects that inherit from class "join"..

Version 0.4-3

	* distance() would work even if factors in x and y had
	different levels. This would result in incorrect 
	dissimilarities for method = "mixed". distance() now
	issues an error if one or more factors have different
	levels in x and y. Use join() to get correct factors
	and levels. Reported by Birgit Lemcke.

	* join() was not correctly merging data frames with factors.
	Factors were converted to internal values, not levels via
	sapply(). Now uses data.frame(lapply(...)) to maintain
	factors intact.
     
	* distance() was not setting the row / column names in the
	case where both x and y were supplied.
     
	* distance() was incorrectly trying to set row / column
	names in the case where a single dissimilarity was being
	calculated.

	* Documentation fixes.
	
Version 0.4-2

   * New fitted method for bootstrap.map. Returns the bootstrap
     fitted values for the training set.

   * getK<- changed to setK<- as this makes much more sense.
     The extractor function getK remains the same.
     
   * Fixed a couple of bugs in residuals.bootstrap.mat and
     print.residuals.bootstrap.mat that affected how the
     results were printed. Now does what it was supposed to do.
     
   * Fixed minor bug in the code that updated the call in
     analog.

   * Added automagical printing of version number on loading
     of the package.
     
   * Numerous documentation tweaks and updates have been
     applied, which simplify package checking and which 
     provide better documentation of certain comples returned
     objects.

Version 0.4-1

   * Fixed silly bug in RMSEP.bootstrap.mat.

Version 0.4-0

   * Changed the components of returned objects from mat,
     bootstrap.mat, predict.mat. This has has knock-on
     effects for several other functions. These have been
     updated to work with the new objects/components.

   * Speeded up bootstrap and predict.mat considerably.
   
   * Speeded up distance for some coefficients and where 'y'
     is missing, by using dist() and vegdist() from package
     'vegan'. Dependency now on 'vegan'.
     
   * k() and k()<- renamed to getK() and getK()<-.
   
   * getK.bootstrap.mat is now able to extract the k
     for the model or the predictions. In either case, the
     bootstrap or the model k can be selected. See ?getK. 
   
   * New argument 'split' in join(), defaults to TRUE. join
     can now unsplit the merged data sets back into 
     individual data frames, though now with common columns
     (i.e. species).
     
   * Bug in cummean() and cumWmean() meant a site could be
     selected as analogue for itself now fixed.
     
   * Bug in mcarlo.mat and mcarlo.analog meant it was not
     reading the stored dissimilarity method correctly.
     
   * maxBias() speeded up through use of tapply() instead of
     aggregate(). Results in speed ups for mat() and 
     bootstrap().
     
   * Screeplot() renamed screeplot(). Now works off the
     screeplot generic function in R >= 2.5.0.
     
   * screeplot method for bootstrapped models now draws
     lines in different colours.
   
   * As a result of the adoption of screeplot(), analogue
     now depends on R >= 2.5.0.
     
   * cma.analog and it's print and summary methods changed
     so that they return an object even if all samples have
     no close modern analogues.     
     
   * New RMSEP method for mat objects. Returns the LOO CV
     RMSEP for a MAT model.
     
   * Fixed minor bug in analog.default and how it recorded
     the call.

Version 0.3-4

   * New roc method for "analog" objects.
   
   * New mcarlo method for "analog" objects.
   
   * mat() now has a formula method and interface.
   
   * cma() is now more efficient, but does not return the
     same object components as before. $distances and $samples
     have been replaced by $close, a list of the close modern
     analogues for each fossil sample, with each component a
     named vector of close modern analogues and their 
     distances.
     
   * A much changed reconPlot(), with a now-working default 
     method that is used by other reconPlot methods.
     reconPlot.predict.mat updated to reflect changes.
   
   * Reverted the class of bootstrap() to "bootstrap.mat".
     
   * Removed Encoding: UTF-8 from package DESCRIPTION file.
   
   * Cut down some of the examples as they now take a while
     to run with the larger data sets and because a vignette
     is in the works they no longer need to be so 
     comprehensive.

Version 0.3-3

   * Updated the example data sets to more complete
     versions. See ?rlgh, ?swapdiat and ?swappH for
     more details.
     
   * Changes to predict.mat to return minimum DC's and
     quantiles of training set DC's.
     
   * Minor tweaks to plot.mat - now display a bit more info
     such as 'k' for chosen model and whether it is weighted
     or not.
   
   * New function minDC() with print and plot methods, for
     extracting and plotting minimum dissimilarity for
     fossil samples. A default method and methods for classes
     "predict.mat" and "analog" are provided.
     
   * New function RMSEP for extracting or calculating RMSEP
     for transfer functions.
     
   * Modified output from print.analog, print.cma to be more
     compact (former) and more descriptive (latter).
     
   * cma() now returns the number of analogues per sample as
     close or close than argument "cutoff". cma() also now
     automatically determines "cutoff" if none supplied.
     
   * plot.cma() was plotting quantile lines for all x$quants
     whether they were greater than x$cutoff or not. Fixed
     to plot only x$quants <= x$cutoff. A check is made to
     determine if any(x$quants <= x$cutoff), and plotting
     of the qunantile lines is supressed if FALSE.
     
   * If 'y' was missing from distance() it was checking for
     and deleting any species (columns) that were all zero.
     
   * plot.mat() was not using the stored value of k in its
     plots. Now that k() can change the stored value plot.mat
     should use this rather than calculate its own k.
     
   * plot.roc() was not drawing 'which = 3 ' correctly.
   
   * Fixed up the citation file.

Version 0.3-2

   * New method for Screeplot for objects of class
     "bootstrap". Plots apparent and bootstrap statistics
     in screeplot format.
   
   * Begun to generalise bootstrap. bootstrap.mat now returns
     an object of class "bootstrap". print, summary, residuals
     and print.summary methods for "bootstrap.mat" have been 
     change to methods for "bootstrap". This is all in 
     preparation for adding other transfer function models to
     analogue in later versions, for which bootstrapping is
     also used.
     
     WARNING: the object returned from bootstrap.mat has 
     changed subtly and will change periodically as new
     transfer functions models are added to allow for
     differences between models. The ultimate aim is to have
     a reasonable generic object "bootstrap" regardless of
     the transfer function model used.

Version 0.3-1 - The New Year edition

   * Added 'stats' and 'graphics' to Depends: in the
     DESCRIPTION. Requested by the CRAN Maintainers.

   * New generic functions 'k' and 'k<-' for extracting and
     replacing the number of analogues stored in models.
     Currently for 'mat' objects only.   
     
   * New dissimilarity coefficient in distance(), for Gower's
     general coefficient of similarity (expressed as a
     distance/dissimilarity) for mixed mode data, including
     factors. Use method = "mixed". 
   
   * Realised that there were a number of different variants
     on Gower's coefficient out there. To be consistent with
     package 'vegan', method = "gower" now computes the same
     coefficient as vegan. The alternative formulation used
     in Version 0.3-0 and earlier is now available as 
     method = "alt.gower".
    
   * distance() now works with missing values for methods
     "gower", "alt.gower" and "mixed" only.
     
   * Renamed ToDo file to TODO, and updated the information
     enclosed.
   
   * Add acknowledgments file THANKS.
   
   * Numerous documentation fixes.

Version 0.3-0

   * First version released to CRAN.
   
   * Minor documentation fixes prior to release.
   
   * Fixed CITATION file, which had old package name. A
     hang over from version 0.1-5.

Version 0.2-7

   * Added new function bayesF() to calculate Bayes factors,
     or likelihood ratios from the results of roc().
     Includes simple print and plot methods, the latter
     being used in plot.roc to provide a 5th plot of
     roc results.
     
   * Added a new plot to plot.roc() - showing the probability
     of analogue (A+). This is now the default 4th plot drawn
     by default, replacing the likelihood ratio plots, which
     are harder to interpret.
     
   * Documentation tweaks to many functions.
   
   * Removed attributes from returned objects of functions
     analog(), cma(), mat(). Former attributes are returned
     as part of the restured object now. Updated all
     functions that made use of these attributes.
     
   * The analog method of cma() has new argument "prob"; a 
     vector of probabilities with values in [0,1], for which
     quantiles of the distribution of training set 
     dissimilarities will be calculated.
   
   * plot.cma() has new arguments; "draw.quant", "col.quant"
     and "lty.quant". These detrmine whether quantile lines
     are drawn on the stripchart, and the colour and line
     type used if they are drawn.
     
   * Restored dimnames to some elements of the returned object
     from bootstrap().
     
   * Streamlined print.summary.cma(), which now uses 
     print.cma() instead of duplicating code.
     
   * Fixed print.summary.predict.mat to return the training
     set assessment.
     
   * Fixed print.predict.mat - wasn;t displaying the 
     bootstrap k.
     
   * Altered summary.analog and its print method. Summary no
     longer uses attributes to store information that is
     subsequently printed.
     
   * Added a package overview help page - access using:
     package?analogue

Version 0.2-6

   * Added new dissimilarity method "gower", for Gower's
     coefficient. Note this version does not implement the 
     mixed version of Gower's coefficient. A future version
     of distance() will include method "gowerMixed" for the
     mixed data version (i.e. for mixed +/-, factor and 
     quantitative data).
     
Version 0.2-5

   * Completely rewrote the mat method for roc(). Based on
     Programmer's Niche article by T. Lumley in R News
     (Vol. 4(1) 33--36). Uses the optimisations in the
     article to calculate the ROC curve itself. Now much 
     faster, and produces a more compact return object than
     before.
     
   * Added a 4th plot to plot.roc(), which draws two 
     definitions of the slope of the ROC curve as 
     likelihood ratios.
   
   * Added documentation for plot method of roc(), 
     including descriptions of what each plot shows.
     
   * New function reconPlot with default and predict.mat
     methods. Draws stratigraphic plots of reconstructions,
     with or without error bars.
   
   * mcarlo() and it's 'default' and 'mat' methods have
     been largely re-written to make them more efficient.
     mcarlo.mat() now access data from the 'mat' object
     and calls mcarlo.default(), so only one set of 
     calculations now needs to be maintained.
     
   * New arguments "diag" and "is.dcmat" for mcarlo().
   
   * Added new dissimilarity methods "manhattan", and
     "kendall" to calculate the Manhattan metric and 
     Kendall's coefficient, respectively, in distance().
     
   * 'method = "information"' was not working correctly
     if p_{ij} or p_{ik} were zero.
     
   * Minor fix to distance(), allows 'method = "chi.distance"'
     to work now. Minor tweaks to documentation to add
     equation for chi^2 distance metric. Still some 
     equations need adding in correct notation.
     
   * Minor updates to documentation and code for analog(), 
     mat() and mcarlo() to reflect additional dissimilarity
     coefficients now available in distance().
     
   * Fixed some formatting issues in bootstrap.Rd and updated
     the documentation of the returned object to match code
     changes in previous versions.
   
   * predict.mat was defaulting to doing bootstrap 
     predictions, which can be time consuming. Default is
     now to return normal predictions. Updates to the example
     for predict.mat to reflect this change.
     
   * Updated the documentation for predict.mat of the 
     returned object to match code changes in previous 
     versions.
     
   * General update of all documentation pages.

Version 0.2-4

   * Reverted the changes to fitted.mat and residuals.mat
     as these functions no longer worked like similar
     methods for other classes in R.
     
   * Altered plot.mat to use fitted and residuals methods
     for mat. Simplified extractions to generate one of the
     plots considerably. Also reverted changes imposed by
     fiddling with predict/fitted earlier.
     
   * Minor tweak to distance() to allow it to calculate
     dissimilarity between two individual samples only. For
     use in mcarlo() for simulation/permutation of
     dissimilarities.
     
   * New function mcarlo(), with default and "mat" methods.
     Experimental functions for simulating dissimilarities
     in order to determine critical values for various
     coefficients for use in identifying analogues.
     
   * New function roc(), with default and "mat" methods. Fits
     Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves following
     the framework of Wahl (2005) to identify the critical
     values of dissimilarity values. Also has a plot method
     for drawing the actual ROC curves.

Version 0.2-3
     
   * some issues with predict.mat() and print method
     associated with fixes for 0.2-2 ironed out. Others
     remain to be fixed - especially when not 
     bootstrapping; need a consistent object representation.
   
   * fitted.mat now returns fitted values for all possible
     k-closest analogues. The kth model that minimises the
     RMSE (Apparent) is returned is user-supplied k not
     given.
     
   * residuals.mat now returns residuals for all possible
     k-closest analogues. The kth model that minimises the
     RMSE (Apparent) is returned is user-supplied k not
     given.
     
   * predict.mat and its print and summary methods now work
     again properly after changes made in 0.2-2.
     
   * summary.mat updated to work with new extractor 
     functions.
     
   * plot.mat updated to work with new extractor functions.

Version 0.2-2

   * bootstrap.mat(), predict.mat() and print and summary
     methods now fixed to return stats for all k-closest 
     models. Needs docs for bootstrap.mat() updating;
     currently the reconstructions are commented out.
   
   * join() was dropping the rownames of the joined
     objects. FIXED

Version 0.2-1

	* New function plot.cma() to plot results of a call to
	  cma(). Uses stripchart() currently. Needs to be made
	  more robust and adaptable to larger sample sizes.

Version 0.2-0

  * Minor documentation tweaks. Release 0.2-0 ready.
    
Version 0.1-9

  * Added new function residuals.bootstrap.mat() and print
    method.
    
  * predict.mat() now doesn't set k to be the model with
    lowest RMSE. If missing(k) in predict.mat(), k is set
    to NULL and bootstrap.mat will choose k giving lowest
    RMSEP assessed by bootstrap. If not using bootstrap
    resampling in predict.mat(), k is still set to the
    the model with lowest RMSE if not supplied.
    
Version 0.1-8

	* Fixed a little bug in predictions for new samples in
	  bootstrap.mat() - was dropping the closest analogue.
	  Uses the newly fixed cumWmean() and cummean() functions
	  and argument "drop = FALSE".
	  
	* Fixed up bootstrap.mat() to have a cleaner return object
	  that is easier to maintain and IMHO use.
	  
	* bootstrap.mat() now uses new code to evaluate predictions
	  for new samples for all k, to match the previous changes
	  to bootstrap.mat(). Removed extraneous code from previous
	  versions.
	  
	* summary.bootstrap.mat() and summary.predict.mat() updated
	  to refer to the new returned object from bootstrap.mat().
	  
	* Updated documentation for bootstrap() and predict.mat()
	  and fixed up examples.
	  
	* Removed old file analogy-internal.Rd - hang over from
	  older package.

Version 0.1-7

	* bootstrap.mat now uses the new code to return all
	  values. The swap example is taking c. 18 secs to run
	  on my laptop (1.8 Ghz P3m), with 1000 bootstraps. Not 
	  too bad. Final code tidy required then release as 
	  Version 0.2-0.
	  
Version 0.1-6

	* Prepared ground work for bootstrap.mat to bootstrap
	  for all k, not just user supplied k. Allows you to 
	  choose size of MAT model based on bootstrap RMSEP and 
	  other stats. Code works in bootstrap.mat() with 
	  argument 'boot.train = TRUE', just needs resulting
	  returned object simplifying and removal of old code
	  that duplicates one set of calcs, and methods written
	  to display/plot the results of bootstrap on the 
	  training set.
	
	* cumWmean() and cummean() adapted for use in 
	  bootstrap.mat() for choosing k. New argument 
	  'drop = TRUE'; controls whether spurious zero distance 
	  is ignored or not in calcuating cumulative stats. 
	  Needed for bootstrapping training set for all k.

Version 0.1-5

	* Changed package name to analogue

Version 0.1-4

   * Added new distance/dissimilarity coefficient to 
     calculate Chi squared distance, sensu Lebart & Fenelon
     (1971) [Statistique et informatique appliquees. Dunod,
     Paris, 426 pp], the distance preserved in 
     correspondence analysis. To use this, use:
     method = "chi.distance".

Version 0.1-3

	* Data set rlgh was incorrectly saved.

Version 0.1-2

	* Fixed a serious bug in join(), where rows were getting
	  dropped if they had exactly the same counts in them.
	  Solution provided by Sundar Dorai-Raj - see source for
	  join() for further details.
	
	* join() now accepts any number of data frames as input,
	  not just two as originally. This is as a result of the
	  fix to join() above.
	  
	* Updated all examples using join() to match new
	  arguments of join().

Version 0.1-1

	* First Development Release

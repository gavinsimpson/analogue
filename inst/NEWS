## Version 1.18-0 **Not yet released**

* `Stratiplot()` gained argument `labelValues`, which allows for custom labelling of variables in a plot. A vector of expressions can be supplied for fancy labelling such as that required for isotopes, equations, sub/superscripts, greek characters, etc.

## Version 1.17-0

* `Stratiplot()` now draws a plot on the current device and returns a `"trellis"` object *invisibly*. This fixes #13 and prevents a blank page being drawn in devices such as `pdf()`.

* `Stratiplot()` now handles a matrix as argument `x` via an S3 method for class `"matrix"`.

* `tran()` add a `"none"` transformation which just returns its input. This is useful if you are writing code and comparing transformations and need to temporarily turn them off.

## Version 1.18-0

  * `distance()` gains new method `"metric.mixed"`, which is a modification of
    existing method `"mixed"` except that ordinal variables are now converted to
    ranks and handled as quantitative variables in Gower's mixed coefficient.

  * `distance()` method `"mixed"` now also handles ordinal data via the
    extensions to Gower's general distance coefficient in Podani (1999, *Taxon*
    **48**, 331--340).

  * Both changes were improved by discussions with, and new code and fixes to my
    buggy C code by, Jari Oksanen. See Issue #15.
  
  * Fixes to example reference output due to a vegan update.

## Version 0.17-6

 * Fixes for CRAN related to digits in printed output.

## Version 0.17-5

 * Fixes for CRAN

## Version 0.17-4

 * Fixes for CRAN

## Version 0.17-3

 * Fix keywords in `weightedCor()`.

## Version 0.17-2

 * `V12.122` The data were stored as proportions but treated as percentages in examples. To better match the `ImbrieKipp` training set, `V12.122` was converted to percentages. Reported by Richard Telford #22.

## Version 0.17-1

 * `prcurve` modified to use package **princurve** version >= 2.0.2.
 
 * `join()` had a serious bug that caused the columns to be labelled incorrectly when a `type = "left"`join was used, if the columns weren't in the same order in the data frames to be merged. Issue #16

 * `Stratiplot()` gained argument `labelValues`, which allows for custom labelling of variables in a plot. A vector of expressions can be supplied for fancy labelling such as that required for isotopes, equations, sub/superscripts, greek characters, etc.
 
 * The `Climate` data set had incorrectly-named columns and was missing some variables. The NAMPD is now updated to version 1.7-3 and the name and missing data issues have been fixed. Reported by Simon Goring in Issue #17.

## Version 1.17-0

* `Stratiplot()` now draws a plot on the current device and returns a `"trellis"` object *invisibly*. This fixes #13 and prevents a blank page being drawn in devices such as `pdf()`.

* `Stratiplot()` now handles a matrix as argument `x` via an S3 method for class `"matrix"`.

* `tran()` add a `"none"` transformation which just returns its input. This is useful if you are writing code and comparing transformations and need to temporarily turn them off.
